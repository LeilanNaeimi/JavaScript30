* An HTML page displays a collection of div elements, each containing a letter that corresponds with a key on the keyboard, and the name     of the soundclip to be played when that button is clicked. When a user presses a key that matches one of the letters displayed in the      div elements, the page should play the corresponding soundclip and place a temporary 'highlight' (or border) around the div. Write the     JavaScript code necessary to add this functionality.

* I also added volumn controle.
